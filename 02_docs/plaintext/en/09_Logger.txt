=== LOGGER class

== Overview

Logger class gives you ability to write messages into log files and console from every class you have.
It creates a file only when it's really necessary (i.e. when first message was sent in Logger object).
When you compile your project in Debug configuration, the application will also have a console window.
It can be used to see when messages are written into log.

== Functions

 template<class T> Logger& operator<<(const T& p)
  Writes a T class' value into file and console streams.
  Returns a reference to Logger object so it can be used like a chain:
  Logger::log << a << b << c << d << e;

 void start_session()
  Ends previous session (if it was started) and removes old log files.

 void end_session()
  Ends current session (if it was started) and closes log files (so something else will be able to open these).

  Is attached to log.txt file and cout console stream.
  Use: Logger::log << "message".
