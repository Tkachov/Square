=== IMAGE class

== Overview

Image class is used by engine to storage textures (and corresponding bitmaps). It inherits Object class, so you can use Image objects to place a static picture on the screen (pointer to Image is returned by Loader::load_texture()). It's recommended to use Sprite class though.

== Functions

 void draw() [inherited from Object]
  Draws the texture this object contains.

 void draw(int x, int y) [inherited from Object]
  Draws the texture this object contains in given point.

 void update(Input*) [inherited from Object]
  If mouse pointer is on the texture and intersects it, then “eats” mouse move event. If %this.eat_click% is true, “eats” mouse click event too.

 GLuint* const img()
  Returns OpenGL's texture ID.

 SDL_Surface* const bmp()
  Returns SDL's bitmap surface.

 bool eating_clicks()
  Returns whether %this.eat_click% is true or not.
 (Look void update(Input*).)

 int w()
  Returns bitmap width.

 int h()
  Returns bitmap height.

 int pw()
  Returns texture width (can be only power of 2).

 int ph()
  Returns texture height (can be only power of 2).

 void set_eating_clicks(bool)
  Sets %this.eat_click% value.
 (Look void update(Input*).)

 void set_img(GLuint*)
  Sets OpenGL's texture ID. Does not free the memory of previous texture ID.

 void set_bmp(SDL_Surface* s)
  Sets SDL's bitmap surface. Does not free the memory of previous bitmap surface.
