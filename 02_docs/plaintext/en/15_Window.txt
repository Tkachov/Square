=== WINDOW class

== Overview

Window class can be used to show windows on the screen. It inherits both Object and Screen classes, so it can be placed to Screen's queue and can contain Objects itself. It provides only simplest base for windows and can't be used to create windows in run-time.

Windows are pausing input and unpausing it to update its' own and its' children state.

== Deriving a Window class

As Screen object, Window can (and should) override load() function. Window class also provides another virtual function:

 void disappear()
  This function destroys the object and removes it from Screen's queue.

You also can override usual Object class virtual functions to make an unique window. Don't forget that you should both handle the input and notify child Objects to handle it.
