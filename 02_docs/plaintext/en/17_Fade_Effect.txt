=== FADE_EFFECT class

== Overview

Fade_Effect class can be used to create some fade-in or fade-out effects. It inherits Object class.
There are Fade_Mode enum, which has the following values:
	m_FADE_IN, 
	m_FADE_OUT,
	m_IMAGE_IN,
	m_IMAGE_OUT

m_FADE_IN and m_IMAGE_IN are making something visible from complete invisibility, m_FADE_OUT and m_IMAGE_OUT are making the opposite — making something invisible from complete visibility.

m_IMAGE_IN and m_IMAGE_OUT can be used to make fade-in or fade-out effect with image.
m_FADE_IN and m_FADE_OUT can be used to make fade-in or fade-out effect with color.

== Functions

 Fade_Effect(Fade_Mode mode, int delay, functor* func = 0, int x = 0, int y = 0, int priority = 0)
  Constructor, creates new Fade_Effect with given %mode% that will last %delay% frames and call %func% after fade effect is complete. It also gets position and %priority% for Object constructor.

 virtual void draw(SDL_Surface*) [inherited from Object]
  Draws the effect on the screen.

 virtual void update(Input*) [inherited from Object]
  Updates the state.

 void color_mode(int r, int g, int b, int w, int h)
  This function can be called to set m_FADE_IN or m_FADE_OUT modes color and width and height parameters.

 void image_mode()
  This function can be called to switch to m_IMAGE_IN or m_IMAGE_OUT modes.

 Sprite* spr()
  Returns a pointer to Sprite object which can be changed.
