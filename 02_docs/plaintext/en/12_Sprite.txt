=== SPRITE class

== Overview

Sprite class can be used to draw images and animations on the screen. It inherits Object class. Sprites can be created manually, though it's recommended to load it using Loader::load_sprite() function.

== Functions

 Sprite()
  Contructor, creates an empty sprite (with no frames at all).
 
 Sprite(Image i)
  Constructor, creates a sprite with one frame which is given Image.

 virtual void draw(SDL_Surface*) [inherited from Object]
  Draws sprite's frame on the screen.

 virtual void draw(int,int,SDL_Surface*) [inherited from Object]
  Draws sprite's frame on the screen with given offset by X and Y axises.

 virtual void update(Input*) [inherited from Object]
  Does animating.

 void set_frame(GLuint* texture, SDL_Surface* bitmap, int width, int height, int pw, int ph);
  Replaces all sprite's frames with one new frame which is Image, created from given texture, bitmap and their width and height parameters.

 void add_frame(GLuint* texture, SDL_Surface* bitmap, int width, int height, int pw, int ph);
  Adds one new frame which is Image, created from given texture, bitmap and their width and height parameters.

 void set_frame(Image)
  Replaces all sprite's frames with one new frame which is given Image.

 void add_frame(Image)
  Adds one new frame which is given Image.

 GLuint* const frame(unsigned int k = 0)
  Returns a pointer to %k%th frame's texture or 0 if %k%th frame doesn't exists.

 unsigned int current_index()
  Returns an index of current frame (i.e. frame which is drawn at this moment).

 GLuint* const current_frame()
  Returns a pointer to current frame's texture (or 0, if there are no frames at all).

 Image const image(unsigned int k = 0)
  Returns an Image object corresponding to %k%th frame. If %k%th frame doesn't exists, returns an empty Image (i.e. Image(0,0,0,0,0,0)).

 Image const current_image()
  Returns an Image object corresponding to current frame (or an empty Image, if there are no frames at all).

 SDL_Surface* const bitmap(unsigned int k = 0)
  Returns a pointer to %k%th frame's bitmap surface or 0 if %k%th frame doesn't exists.

 SDL_Surface* const current_bitmap()
  Returns a pointer to current frame's bitmap surface (or 0, if there are no frames at all).

 int animation_speed()
  Returns interval between two frames.

 int w()
  Returns sprite's width. Sprite's width is maximal frames' width.

 int h()
  Returns sprite's height. Sprite's height is maximal frames' height.

 unsigned int length()
  Returns frames count.

 void set_index(unsigned int k)
  Sets current index to %k%.

 void set_speed(int s)
  Sets interval between two frames to %s%.

 bool is_intersected(int mx, int my)
  Returns whether sprite's current frame is intersected in %mx%, %my% position (i.e. %mx%, %my% pixel is not transparent) or not.
