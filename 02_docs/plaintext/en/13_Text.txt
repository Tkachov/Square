=== TEXT class

== Overview

Text class is used to create text labels and draw those on the screen. It inherits Object class. The label can change its' text, font, color, width and antialiasing in run-time (i.e. you don't have to create a new label to change these parameters).

If pointer to font is 0, text won't be drawn until font is replaced with valid pointer.

If label's width is 0 or is negative, text won't have limited width. Otherwise text will be carried over to the next line if necessary (i.e. width limit is exceeded).

== Functions

 Text(TTF_Font* font, string text = "", int width = 0, SDL_Color color = SDL_Color(), int x = 0, int y = 0, int priority = 0)
  Constructor, that requires a font and can also get default text, label's width, color, position and priority.

 virtual void draw(SDL_Surface*) [inherited from Object]
  Draws the text on the screen.

 virtual void draw(int,int,SDL_Surface*) [inherited from Object]
  Draws the text on the screen with given offset by X and Y axises.

 virtual void update(Input*) [inherited from Object]
  Does nothing.

 string const text()
  Returns current text.

 Image* const img()
  Returns a pointer to Image object that contains SDL's bitmap surface with current text drawn. Can be used to determine text's real width or height.

 int const width()
  Returns label's width limit.

 void set_font(TTF_Font* font)
  Sets new font and redraws the label.
  If %font% is 0 or equals to current label's font pointer, it does nothing.

 void set_text(string text)
  Sets new text and redraws the label.
  If %text% equals to current label's text, it does nothing.

 void set_color(SDL_Color& color)
  Sets new color and redraws the label.
  If %color% equals to current label's color, it does nothing.

 void set_antialias(bool aa)
  Sets new antialiasing and redraws the label.
  If %aa% equals to current label's antialiasing option, it does nothing.
  If %aa% is true, antialiasing is turned on, otherwise it is turned off.

 void set_width(int width)
  Sets new width limit and redraws the label.
  If %width% equals to current label's width limit, it does nothing.
